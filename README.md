# Awesome Tern

> Plugins, apps, tools and resources for [Tern](https://stencil.so/tern), Stencil's terminal.

Tern is a Rust-native terminal from [Stencil](https://stencil.so). Shells, [omp](https://omp.sh) agents and browser panes keep running in a daemon when the window closes, and come back after a reboot. One session can be open on the desktop app, on iOS and in a WebGPU browser tab at the same time; typing in one shows up in the others.

Plugins are written in Luau, and any program can draw native UI through the Tern Surface Protocol (TSP). `tern remote serve` serves a remote machine's sessions over QUIC. Tern is in closed beta; you get in through the [waitlist](https://auth.stencil.so/waitlist?app=tern).

## Plugins

Tern plugins are written in Luau and can be installed directly from GitHub with `tern plugin install github.com/OWNER/REPO`. See the [plugin CLI reference](https://docs.stencil.so/tern/reference/cli.html) for the available commands.

### Command lenses

A lens captures a shell command's output and shows it as a native view. A Raw toggle shows the original text.
